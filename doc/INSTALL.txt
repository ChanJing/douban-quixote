Installing Quixote
==================

Best-case scenario
------------------

If you are using Python 2.2 or later, and have never installed Quixote
with your current version of Python, you're in luck.  Just run

  python setup.py install

and you're done.  Proceed to the demo documentation to learn how to get
Quixote working.

If you're using an older Python, or if you're upgrading from an older
Quixote version, read on.


Upgrading from an older Quixote version
---------------------------------------

We strongly recommend that you remove any old Quixote version before
installing a new one.  First, find out where your old Quixote
installation is:

  python -c "import os, quixote; print os.path.dirname(quixote.__file__)"

and then remove away the reported directory.  (If the import fails, then
you don't have an existing Quixote installation.)

Then proceed as above:

  python setup.py install


Using Quixote with Python 2.0 or 2.1
------------------------------------

If you are using Python 2.0 or 2.1 then you need to install the
``compiler`` package from the Python source distribution.  The
``compiler`` package is for parsing Python source code and generating
Python bytecode, and the PTL compiler is built on top of it.  With
Python 2.0 and 2.1, this package was included in Python's source
distribution, but not installed as part of the standard library.

Assuming your Python source distribution is in ``/tmp/Python-2.1.2``::

    cd /tmp/Python-2.1.2/Tools/compiler
    python setup.py install

(Obviously, you'll have to adjust this to reflect your Python version
and where you kept the source distribution after installing Python.)
